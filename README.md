# robinhood

Haskell implementation of a linearly probed hash table using Robin Hood hashing.

For a description of Robin Hood hashing take a look at the following two blog posts:

1. http://codecapsule.com/2013/11/11/robin-hood-hashing/
2. http://codecapsule.com/2013/11/17/robin-hood-hashing-backward-shift-deletion/

## Status

Currently, this is still very experimental but once it stabilizes I
might put it up on Hackage.
